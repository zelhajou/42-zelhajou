# 42cursus

This repository contains my projects developed at [1337](https://1337.ma/en/) programming school for the [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) Cursus, a programming curriculum developed by 42 Paris. The 42 Cursus is an intensive, peer-to-peer learning program designed to teach computer science and programming skills through project-based learning. Each project is graded by peers using a peer-evaluation system called "correction," and successful completion of each project is required to progress to the next level of the program.

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer-to-peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).

For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine repo](https://github.com/zelhajou/42-piscine_c).

## Curriculum

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one is known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.

## Skills

These are some of the skills I've developed during my time at 42.

### Hard-skills

- Computer Systems
    - Distributed Systems (Operating Systems, Linux)
        - Linux Virtualization (KVM/QEMU, Docker)
        - Linux Command-Line Tools and Utilities
            - Text Editors (nano, vim, emacs)
            - Compression and Archiving (tar, gzip, zip)
            - Networking Tools (ping, netstat, nslookup, etc.)
            - System Monitoring (top, htop, iotop, etc.)
            - Package Management Tools
            - Remote Access (ssh, scp)
            - Disk and File System Tools (df, du, lsblk, etc.)
        - Shell and Command Line (Bash, Zsh)

- System-level Programming (C, C++)

### Soft-skills

- **Self-learning and proactivity:** At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer-to-peer learning methodology. There are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring your classmates, and empirical knowledge, with each student learning at their own pace.
- **Teamwork:** Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.
- **Time management and resiliency:** The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the program.
- **Problem-solving:** The projects are designed to challenge the cadets' problem-solving skills, requiring them to think outside the box and find creative solutions to complex problems.
- **Communication:** The peer-to-peer learning methodology requires cadets to communicate effectively with their peers, both to ask for help and to help others. This promotes the development of communication skills, which are essential in the workplace.
